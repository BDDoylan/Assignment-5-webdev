## Goal:

Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a 
RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This 
will cover all of the CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
This will encompass writing models, querying a database with an ORM, 
designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests 
and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state 
of the application with React-Redux, and much more.

1. Home page
2. All campus view
3. All student view
4. Single campus view
5. Single student view
6. Adding student
7. Adding campus
8. Deleting student
